### Aim of the Study

The aim of this study is to test ***6 different models*** based on the **Sex, Age** and **Parent-Child** information of the Titanic Data and to determine the best model for survival prediction. 
  
### Models Tested in Order
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Linear Regression
  
### Information About Data Features

**Variable > Definition > Key**  
- ***Survived*** = Survival > 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
- ***Pclass*** = Ticket class > 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd   
- ***age*** = Age > Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5  
- ***SibSp*** = # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic  
Sibling (brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister)  
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)  
- ***Parch*** = # of parents / children aboard the Titanic  
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them  
- ***Ticket*** = Ticket number  
- ***Fare*** = Passenger fare  
- ***Cabin*** = Cabin number  
- ***Embarked*** = Port of Embarkation > C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
